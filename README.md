# Tree Structure File Management

A simple file management system with tree structure using React and Node.js.

## Description
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a file management system with a tree structure. It allows users to manage folders and files in a hierarchical manner. Users can add new folders, delete folders (excluding root folders), and view the contents in a structured tree view.

The front end is built with React using the RSuite UI library for components and icons. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, with a MySQL database for storing the folder structure.


## Features
